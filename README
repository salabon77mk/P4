IMPORTANT MAKEFILE STUFF:
Since we're submitting without a main file and gcc will get mad, if you would like to compile every file
including a driver file in one go, modify the OBJ variable at the top by adding any additional files you need.

We decided to use red black trees to represent the range tree, in particular, we implemented Robert Sedgewick's RBTs from his Algorithms 4th edition textbook.
Various functions had to be adjusted or reimplemented altogether to work in a C environment and for this particular assignment such as delete and range search.

In 537malloc, we had to figure out a way to deal with overlapping memory regions for malloc.
We realized if there was a large amount of nodes, the simplest way to deal with such a range
is to delete all but the first node which we treat as a base case of sorts where we would either
restructure that one node or split it depending on the situation
